# 🚗 US Traffic Accident Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This project performs detailed EDA on US traffic accident data, uncovering trends and patterns using data cleaning and visualizations.

## 📌 Description
The dataset contains traffic accident records across the US. The project involves:
- Data preprocessing
- Missing value imputation
- Group-wise aggregations by city/state/year
- Visualizing accident severity, time zones, and weather conditions
- Geographic mapping of accidents

## 📊 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📁 Dataset
- File: US_Accidents_March23.csv
- Source: Kaggle

## 💡 Key Insights
- Most accidents occur in Miami and California
- Morning is the riskiest time of day
- Year 2021 had the highest accident count
- Fair weather dominates accident conditions
- Severity level 2 is most common

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install requirements:
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

2. Put `US_Accidents_March23.csv` in the project folder.

3. Run:
   python traffic_accident_eda.py

## 📈 Visualizations
- Bar charts: Cities, States, Years
- Pie chart: Severity distribution
- Time-based histograms
- Scatter plots: Accident locations
- Bar charts for weather conditions

## ✅ Conclusion
This project provides data-driven insights to improve road safety, identify accident-prone areas, and support transportation policy decisions.
